This project has 3 main parts. First, you are to write a set of test cases that can be used to help test implementation of a particular database API. Second, you are to create a standalone “library” that will implement that database API, and that will meet the functionality described in the test cases. Finally, you will implement a basic database application program that makes use of a database implementation provided by a different team.
